## 🟢Greenhouse Gas Emissions Predictor
A data analysis and visualization project that explores greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across various US industries and commodities using the Supply Chain Emission Factors dataset.

This project demonstrates how to extract insights from static emission factor data and lays the groundwork for building predictive tools to estimate GHG output based on economic activity.

📁 Dataset

Source: SupplyChainEmissionFactorsforUSIndustriesCommodities.xlsx
Sheet Used: 2016_Summary_Commodity
The dataset includes:

Commodity names and codes

Greenhouse gas substances (e.g., CO₂, CH₄, N₂O)

Emission factors (kg CO₂e per USD)

Data quality assessment metrics

🎯 Objective
Understand which commodities contribute the most to supply chain GHG emissions.

Visualize top emitting industries.

Prepare the dataset for potential predictive modeling.

Allow estimation of GHG emissions based on economic input values.

📊 Key Features
✅ Cleaned and preprocessed Excel data

✅ Visualized top 10 emitting commodities using Seaborn & Matplotlib

✅ Grouped emissions by commodity and substance

✅ Prepared the data for integration with economic activity for prediction

✅ Potential for expansion into a GHG prediction tool or API

🧠 How Prediction Works (Concept)
💡 Predicted Emission (kg CO₂e) = Emission Factor × Economic Output (USD)

This formula can estimate emissions for any commodity if paired with real or projected economic data.
